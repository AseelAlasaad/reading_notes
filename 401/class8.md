# Reading: Access Control (ACL)

# Review, Research, and Discussion

**When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?**

The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret. The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token.

**What does the JSON Web Token package do?**

way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

**What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**

Encrypts secrets at rest using encryption keys

# Vocabulary Terms

* encryption: Encryption is the process of taking plain text, like a text message or email, is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
* token:  is an object that represents something else,Tokens are the smallest elements of a program, which are meaningful to the compiler
* bearer: 
Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens

* JSON Web Token: is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims

**role-based access control (RBAC)**

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization

What is RBAC?

RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs


Access control lists (ACL)

 An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.
