# Big O 

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors: 

• Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity) 

The amount of time a function needs to complete. 

• Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity) 

The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.


Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job.

we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis:

* Input Size

* Units of Measurement

* Orders of Growth

* Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case

**Input Size:** 

Input Size refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm
We will use the letter n to refer to the Input Size value

**Units of Measurement:** 

To evaluate a function for Time and Space complexity.

**Order of Growth:** 
represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.

The number 1 is used to represent a constant value

Big O(oh): This notation describes the Worst Case.

Big Omega: This notation describes the Best Case

Big Theta: This notation describes the Average Case

## Linked Lists: 

**What is a Linked List**

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list

* Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list


* Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node
