**Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server**

*  Nock

* MockServer

* Postman Mock Server

**Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?**

apiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page; Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.

apiDocjs and Swagger Inspector can be primarily classified as "API" tools.

**Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST**

The difference is: SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style. SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider, whereas REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data. SOAP invokes services by calling RPC method, REST just simply calls services via URL path

WRRC: web request/response cycle

### Introducing Node

 Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.

 Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems.

 Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS.

 It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.

 You can use Node.js to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.

 **What is NPM?**

 npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

 Use npm to:

 * Download standalone tools you can use right away.
 * Run packages 
 * Share code with any npm user

 What is TDD?

 Test-driven development refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design

 CI/CD

 CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment
CI is the process of integrating code into a mainline code base.
CD is more complicated. CD is about the processes that have to happen after code is integrated for app changes to be delivered to users
