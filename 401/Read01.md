# How to think like a programmer


**what should you do when you encounter a new problem?**

Here are the steps:

* Understand : Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them

*  Plan : Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution. In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

*  Divide : This is the most important step of all.break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.Then, solve each sub-problem one by one.Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem

* Stuck?  

  here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

   * Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong

   * Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

   * Research: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems

   
**Practice**

 If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!   


## 5 Whys

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

**How to Use the 5 Whys**

1. Assemble a Team  :  Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem : If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

3. Ask the First "Why?" : Ask your team why the problem is occurring

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times

5. Know When to Stop

6. Address the Root Cause(s)

7. Monitor Your Measures
