# Review, Research, and Discussion

* Why is the Context API useful?

  allows you to share information to any component, by storing it in a central place and allowing access to any component that requests it 
* Can a component outside of a provider get its context?


 To access a React context outside of the render function, we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default      context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext .

* Describe “Context Hell”

 Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.
 
 

# Term

* global state:  global state is the data that is shared between all the components within a React application.

* provider: The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components
* consumer: A React component that subscribes to context changes

**what is role based access control?**
  
  Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
  
  BENEFITS OF RBAC
Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security. Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis. With hundreds or thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each user’s established role within the organization.
