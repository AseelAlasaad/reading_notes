# Review, Research, and Discussion

* Why is the Context API useful?

  allows you to share information to any component, by storing it in a central place and allowing access to any component that requests it 
* Can a component outside of a provider get its context?


 To access a React context outside of the render function, we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default      context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext .

* Describe “Context Hell”

 Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

* consumer: A React component that subscribes to context changes
