# Read: Stacks & Queues

**What is a Stack**

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

**Common terminology for a stack is**

* Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.

* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped

* Top - This is the top of the stack.

* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack

* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false

**FILO**

First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack

**LIFO**

Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
