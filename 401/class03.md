**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**

* Easier to refactor 
* High test coverage 
* Easier to maintain

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. ... Tests should be explicit, and tests should never share state.

**What is one downside of Test Driven Development**


TDD is Time Consuming and Costly, in both Short Term and Long Term. In previous section we've already discussed why TDD is time consuming in short term: you have to spend significant time on refactoring and rewriting your code. But in the long term it will cost more time as well

**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

ES5 function constructors :this  also uses a new operator for object creation but focuses on how the objects are being instantiated

ES6 class constructors: This can be said to be a syntax base for constructor functions and instantiate objects using a new operato

**Why REST?**

 REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It's an architectural pattern for creating web services. A RESTful service is one that implements that pattern.REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia
 
 functional programming:  is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.
 
 object-oriented programming (OOP):  is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods. Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another
