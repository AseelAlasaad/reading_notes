# Reading: Component Based UI

# Review

* Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

# Term

* Rendering : Javascript uses the document object model (DOM) to manipulate the DOM elements. Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser

* Templates:  is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.

* State: can be updated in response to event handlers, server responses, or prop changes. This is done using the setState() method.
