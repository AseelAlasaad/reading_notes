# Review, Research, and Discussion

* Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle


First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. ... Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

 server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.
