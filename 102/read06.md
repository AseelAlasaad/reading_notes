CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout,CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (<h1>).
  
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
