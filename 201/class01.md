  There are four required tags in HTML. These are html, title, head and body.
  *  < title > The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser
  *  < head >  Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. 
  *  < body >  Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
 Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something  about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
