# HTML and CSS

HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),HTML is known as a language used for describing the structure of the web pages,As for the CSS, it is the language used for describing the presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.

  | tag   |  meaning            |
  | ---   |  -----------        |
  |< h1 > | first heading       |
  |< p >  | paragraph           |
  |< img> | image               |
  |< a >  | Links               |
  |< br > |single line break    |
  |< li > |list item            |
  |< ul > |unordared list       |
  
  There are four required tags in HTML. These are html, title, head and body.
  *  < title > The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser
  *  < head >  Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. 
  *  < body >  Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
 Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something  about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
