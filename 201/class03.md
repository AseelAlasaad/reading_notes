## List in HTML 


There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.


 * Ordered List

   The ordered list is created with
    the < ol> element.Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li> tag
    and a closing < /li> tag.
     Example:
```html
      <ol>
     <li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
     <li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
     minutes until tender< /li>
    </ol>
```
* Unordered List

  The unordered list is created
  with the < ul > element.Each item in the list is placed between an opening < li> tag
  and a closing </ li> tag
  Example:
```html
   <ul>
   <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
   <li>100ml milk</li>
   </ul>

```


 * Definition list


  The definition list is created with
  the < dl> element and usually
  consists of a series of terms and
  their definitions.Inside the < dl> element you will usually see pairs of < dt> and
  < dd> elements.

  < dt > :This is used to contain the term
  being defined (the definition
  term).

< dd >: This is used to contain the
  definition.

  Example
```html
   <dl>
   <dt>Sashimi</dt>
   <dd> Sliced raw fish that is served with
    condiments such as shredded daikon radish   
    or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
    </dl>


```

**Lists can be nested inside one another.**

## CSS

how to control the appearance of the
box using CSS.You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes.

* Box Dimensions (Width, height)
  
  To set your own dimensions for a
  box you can use the height and
  width properties.

  Example:
```html
<div>
<p>The Moog company pioneered the commercial
manufacture of modular voltage-controlled
analog synthesizer systems in the early
1950s.</p>
</div>

div.box {
height: 300px;
width: 300px;
background-color: #bbbbaa;}

```
#### Bording , Margin & Padding

 * Bording : The border
 separates the edge of one box
 from another.

  The border-width property
   is used to control the width
   of a border.

  You can control the style of a
  border using the border-style
   property.

    * solid : a single solid line

    * dotted : a series of square dots

    * dashed:  a series of short lines
You can specify the color of a
border using either RGB values,
hex codes or CSS color names 


*  Margin : Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

 * Padding : Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.The value of this property is
most often specified in pixels

display : The display property allows
you to turn an inline element
into a block-level element or vice
versa, and can also be used to
hide an element from the page.

The values this property can
take are:

* inline

* block

* inline-block 

* none : This hides an element from the
page.

The visibility property allows
you to hide boxes from users
but It leaves a space where the
element would have been.
This property can take two
values:
hidden
This hides the element.
visible
This shows the element.

#### JavaScript
