# HTML 

## Links

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another.

Links are created using the < a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening < a > tag and the closing < /a > tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening
< a> tag and closing < /a> tag
is known as link text.

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

Email Links: mailto,to create a link that starts up the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address.

Opening links in a new window:
target If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
< a > tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

```html

<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">
Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)



```

## images

< img> To add an image into the page
you need to use an < img>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:

1. src :This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL

2. alt: This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

## LAYOUT

Building Blocks : This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

Block-level elements  start on a new line
Examples include:
< h1> < p> < ul> < li>

low in between surrounding text
Examples include:
< img> < b> < i>

## JavaScript

functions, methods, and objects

Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize the code.

* Functions $ methods :
Functions consist ofa series of statements
that have been grouped together because they 
perform a specific task.
A method is the same as a function.

* Objects : programmers use objects to create models of the world using data, and that objects are made up of properties and methods.


the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads. when you create a function you need to give function name after write **function** key word , That name should describe the task it is performing. and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
