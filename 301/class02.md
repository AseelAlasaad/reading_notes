# State and Props

React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states. Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting are the three phases of the component lifecycle.

* Mounting

When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting

* Updating

Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.
static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render,
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate, UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps

* Unmounting

The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.

**Converting a Function to a Class**

You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

* Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
* Add a single empty method to it called render().
* Move the body of the function into the render() method.
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
* Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```html 

class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```

**Handling Events**

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.There are some syntax differences:

* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

Example , the HTML 

```html

<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Example , the React 

```html
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault.

In React
```html
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:

```html
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

```
When using React, you generally donâ€™t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.
