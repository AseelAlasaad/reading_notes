## differences between SQL and NoSQL databases

| SQL     |   NoSQL |
|---------|---------|
|called as Relational Databases | called as non-relational|
|table based databases,represent data in form of tables         | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores        |  
| predefined schema         | dynamic schema for unstructured data.        |   
|   vertically scalable        |  horizontally scalable.       | 
|uses SQL for defining and manipulating the data,which is very powerful      |  queries are focused on collection of documents  |   






**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

table based databases,SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores  

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data)

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.


**What does SQL stand for?**

stands for Structured Query Language

**What is a realational database?**


A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each having a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of value.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

 schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information

 **What is a NoSQL database?**
 NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases

 **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

 MongoDB,It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database,it gives good performance
