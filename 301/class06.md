What is node.js?

Node.js is a free open source server environment that use Javascript runtime for server side web development.Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi, It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

Introducing npm:

The letters npm stand for “node package manager”,When you are working on a JavaScript project, you can use npm to install other people’s code packages into your own project.

Some examples of npm packages are:

    * Angular
    * React
    * jQuery

There are thousands of packages published on npm . To use npm packages in a project, your project must contain a file called package.json. This file keeps a list of all the packages you are using, and which version of each one you have chosen to use.If your file does not have a package.json then you can create one from the command line by running 'npm init' inside your project.

**What version of node are you running on your machine?**
 to find out what version is installed on your computer through the command prompt, we type the following into the command prompt line.
 * node -v:

 After running this line of code, I get the following output below.

     v14.17.1

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

Open the terminal & type below command:

    npm -v ( short command ) **OR** 
    npm --version ( long command )

After running this line of code, I get the following output below.

    6.14.13

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

Open your terminal and type the following:

* Installing a Package Globally:

    npm install -g jshint

**What is node used for?**

They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

Node.js has proved itself useful for developing applications that make use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client as well as on the server side.


**Pair Programming:**

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

*  Greater efficiency

* Engaged collaboration

* Learning from fellow students : Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.

* Social skills : Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key
