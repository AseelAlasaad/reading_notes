# JavaScript's expressions and operators

The javascript operators include:

* Assignment operators 
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand, The simple assignment operator is equal (=).


* Comparison operators 

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true,

not equal (!=): returns **true** if the operands are not equal.

equal (==): returns **true** if the operands are equal.

greater than (>):returns **true** if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

* Logical operators  

Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values.
AND: return true  if both operands are true
OR: return true  if one of operands are true, and not operator.

* Arithmetic operators 

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values  and returns a single numerical value,like multiplication(*),plus(+).
